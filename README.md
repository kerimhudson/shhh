# SHHH!

SHHH! is a small library for hashing sensitive data, such as passwords. It comes with a similar to the bcrypt npm package, but utilises scrypt which is built into the node crypto library. It comes in two variations, depending on your preferred method of utilising a library.

### Usage

**Method 1**

```js
import shhh from "@kerimhudson/shhh";

const { hash, compare } = shhh("PEPPER"); // you can add an optional pepper here if you'd want a bit more security
const user = { email: "john@mail.com", password: "supersecretpassword" };

const hashedPassword = hash(user.password); // returns hashed password, utilising the pepper if provided
const isSamePassword = compare(user.password, hashedPassword); // returns true
```

**Method 2**

```js
import { hash, compare } from "@kerimhudson/shhh";

const user = { email: "john@mail.com", password: "supersecretpassword" };
const pepper = "PEPPER";
const hashedPassword = hash(user.password, pepper); // returns hashed password, utilising the pepper if provided
const isSamePassword = compare(user.password, hashedPassword, pepper); // returns true
```

Use of the `pepper` is entirely optional. Some argue that it allows for a slightly hardened security as it includes a value that is not within the database. If you do use the `pepper`, store this value outside of the database, for example as an environment variable.
